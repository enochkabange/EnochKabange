		<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>I was born in Navrongo in the Upper East region of Ghana. <br> I grew up as a very curious person even though I Hardly showed it. I would look up stuff I didnâ€™t understand and ask questions when it needed to. <br> Most of what I learn is through observation and experience. I always wanted to be a programmer but I found a filed that intrigued me even though I can still make use of some programming knowledge in that field. <br> I fell in love with marketing. This opened doors in the area of entrepreneurship and I started my first company WordInspired media. I loved the idea of being an inspiration and motivation to others. </p>
